      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate and driven 2nd-year BTech student with a focus on
        building practical skills in web development and software engineering.
        Currently expanding my knowledge in full-stack development, I've
        completed projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like
        React and Node.js. With experience in creating dynamic, user-friendly
        websites and applications, my goal is to bring innovative ideas to life.
        <br />
        Through internships and personal projects, like building a job board
        website and a project management tool, I've developed a strong
        foundation in coding and problem-solving. I'm excited to continue
        learning and collaborating on projects that create real-world impact.
